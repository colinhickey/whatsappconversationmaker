# whatsappconversationmaker

This simple clientside app is written in html, css and js
It allows you to create a back and forth conversation in a whatsapp looking UI. You can then click the download the conversation as an image.

This was the first version, just a quick weekend idea.

Uses dom-to-image for the image download function.
